# Fall-Detector
The project is primarily developed for monitoring Differently abled people using Arduino UNO.
●	The system consists of a Gyroscope and a Accelerometer to monitor the person’s movement and when a sudden movement is detected or when the angle of the system goes above the threshold then a fall has occurred.
●	The system can be mounted on the chair of the person and when a fall is detected a message is sent using an Wi-Fi module to an Android Application which can be accessed remotely. 
●	It also provides a Surveillance system for monitoring the person using a video camera which can be remotely operated.
